# machine_learning_projects

This repository contains a variety of machine learning algorithms as well as practical projects where I use machine learning to solve particular problems.

At the moment, this repository has the following files:
- gradient_descent.ipynb: Jupyter notebook showing the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm in one and two dimensions, including animations to visualize how the algorithm works.
- lin_reg.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with a class that performs simple linear regression. In addition, the performance of the class is compared to that of the built-in linear regression of scikit-learn.
- log_reg.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with a class that performs logistic regression. In addition, the performance of the class is compared to that of the built-in linear regression of scikit-learn.
